For a model network N on n taxa given in Newick notation, symCF will compute all 3 cdot binomn4 concordance factors.  The main function network_expectedCF_formulas can return either numerical CFs or symbolic ones, with an option to save a DataFrame of symbolic CFs to a csv file. \n\nSymbolic quartet CFs might be used for studying the mathematical identifiability of phylogenetic tree and network parameters under the NMSC with techniques from algebraic statistics.  To that end, symCF has options to create output files in Macaulay2, Singular, and MATLAB format.  The Macaulay2 and Singular files define the parameterized algebraic variety associated to the network N under the NMSC, and include lines to compute the implicit description of V.  The MATLAB file is a script that computes the dimension of the parameterization map.\n\nThis package builds on the Julia package QuartetNetworkGoodnessFit.jl.\n\nNote: This project was started during the Algebraic Methods in Phylogenetics Workshop, which was held at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa.
